        <div class="col-lg-98">
          <div class="categories">
            <p>Under the global post COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing Russia-Ukraine war era, local and innovative
              solutions to service
              delivery in contexts where traditional actors or the market have failed are needed more than ever
              (Agapitova et al.,
              2020). Unemployment anxieties, psychological trauma disturbances, health problems and undesirable
              economic shocks have
              hit the poor, vulnerable, and those in the informal economy the hardest, particularly in Africa.
              Populations struggle to
              meet their most basic needs for food, water, energy, or health care following job loss and sickness.
              Businesses face
              lower demand for their products and services, which creates high cash flow concerns. When available,
              governments’
              policies and measures are not easily accessible in rural areas or to unregistered workers and firms.
              These challenges
              increasingly deteriorate the hard living environment in weak communities and fragile African countries
              such as
              Congo-Kinshasa (DRC).
              A review of international experiences by the World Bank (2016) demonstrates that an increasing number of
              governments
              across the world successfully include Social Entreprises (SEs) in their policy agendas to address
              institutional and
              market failures in service delivery to the poor and to promote sustainable and equitable growth. SEs are
              private
              non-profit, for-profit or hybrid organizations that use business methods to advance their social mission
              in a
              financially sustainable way. SEs focus on maximizing the public good as opposed to maximizing short-term
              profits for
              their shareholders and private owners. Due to their strong presence and understanding of local
              communities, SEs are
              often able to reach the underserved through innovative solutions. In addition to economic growth and
              wealth generation,
              social entrepreneurs can also create considerable social benefits, especially when they push the
              frontier of developing
              markets and start delivering critical goods and services to poor and marginalized populations.
              Although Africa is a relative latecomer to social business (entrepreneurship), the expansion of SEs
              across the continent
              has been impressive in the last decade. The 2016 survey of a sample of 234 successful social
              entrepreneurs in East and
              Southern Africa demonstrated considerable sectoral growth since 2006. South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, and
              Nigeria for
              instance have become hubs for SEs that are active across all service delivery areas and many are
              reaching impressive
              scale. Assessments of SE ecosystems have showed that SEs improved access to education, clean water, and
              energy for
              millions of Africans, including in the most fragile areas (Navarrete and Agapitova 2017). However, the
              continent social
              business dynamics needs to be sustainably reinforced and many other countries need to adopt and
              implement the model. In
              some African countries, the private sector’s emergence in providing goods and services is constrained by
              the difficult
              country’s contexts. In others, though many opportunities exist for service provision through
              concessions, public-private
              partnerships (PPP), and other private sector initiatives, market-based solutions are rare and relatively
              small in scale.
              Elsewhere, projects that aim to develop basic service delivery units, such as roads, schools and
              clinics, are not based
              on sustainable business models powered by local entrepreneurs.
              With the rapid increase of population in Africa and the existing and emerging complex social problems
              namely brought by
              the COVID-17 pandemic and ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, making Africa one of the world most
              vulnerable places, there
              is an urgent need for a broader panafrican thinking and collaboration in considering the issue, which
              aids and inspires
              far greater commitment for social innovation. The DRC Social Innovation Summit (DRC-SIS) is envisioned
              to contribute to
              strengthen this important and strategic discussion on social innovation in DRC by inspiring and
              implementing innovative
              and sustainable solutions for climate change adaptation and resilience, particularly in Africa.

                <h3> SUMMIT RATIONAL</h3>
                <p>According to UNICEF, the African population will reach 2.4 billion by 2050, with the vast majority
                  under the age of 35.
                  To feed and employ this population, catalytic innovations in health, education, agriculture,
                  transportation, water
                  management, energy, sanitation, and housing will be required. Sustainable improvements in service
                  delivery in Africa
                  will not happen without the participation and capacity building of local actors. The retrenchment of
                  the State,
                  decentralization (devolution), and liberalization of some service sectors have the potential to
                  bring development closer
                  to people and open the door for the private sector (World Bank, 2018).
  
                  While the African continent and Congo-Kinshasa have emerging social innovators and entrepreneurs,
                  they face challenges
                  in scaling and replicating their initiatives, sustaining them in the face of insufficient funding
                  and intellectual
                  property frameworks, fostering cross-sector partnerships, and measuring impact. In the face of
                  complex social
                  challenges, there is an urgent need to advance social innovation as a transformational engine. It is
                  also critical to
                  consider cross-sector collaboration in order to achieve social transformation. Simultaneously, it is
                  critical to
                  consider the transformative power of social innovation and its importance to our society. There are
                  numerous players in
                  the social entrepreneurship ecosystem who contribute to the diversity of social enterprise support.
                  A single actor
                  cannot successfully resolve the complexities of social problems. The effective growth of social
                  enterprise in Africa
                  necessitates collaboration and synergy among ecosystem players. It is critical to connect various
                  actors in social
                  entrepreneurship, maintain conversation among them, and learn from one another.
                  Therefore, DRC-SIS is an event that brings together the various players from across Congo-Kinshasa,
                  Africa and
                  internationally in order for them to be more effective in their support they provide for the growth
                  of the ecosystem. We
                  must learn from social innovations that have proven to be successful in Congo and other African
                  countries, and that can
                  be replicated elsewhere. Hence is it important to connect social entrepreneurs to learn from
                  successful social
                  innovations and create partnerships for replicating the models.</p>

                <div class="content">
                  <p>According to Frantz Fanon, one of the most prominent panafricanists, “Africa has the shape of a
                    revolver whose trigger
                    is in Congo”. This description of the Congo is enough to understand non only the importance of
                    this country in the heart
                    of Africa, but also its potential for envisaging domestic and innovative solutions to service
                    delivery in the continent:
                    second largest and fourth most populated African country, 50% of African forest, 80.000.000 of
                    arable lands, 37% of the
                    potential of African energy, ¾ of the world reserve of coltan, 50% of cobalt, 30% of diamonds and
                    10% of copper.
                    Although the DRC is a relative latecomer to social business, the sector is growing and receiving
                    increased recognition
                    from customers, donors, and the government. Equally important has been the remarkable re-emergence
                    of grassroots SEs as
                    an integral part of a Congolese bottom-up phenomenon, and the rapid rise of new information and
                    communication technology
                    (ICT) in certain areas of service delivery (Agapitova et al., 2020). By choosing Kinshasa as the
                    host city of this
                    panafrican conference on social innovation, we would like to celebrate the Congo’s geostrategic
                    position in Africa and
                    reinforce the social innovation dynamics in view to unlocking the panafrican sustainable
                    development dream.</p>

                  <p>The summit will showcase the powerful stories that are changing the continent, models of
                    sustainable
                    employment,
                    production and consumption, health and justice systems that can be replicated. The conference will
                    seek
                    practical
                    solutions to social challenges that the continent is confronted with in the post-COVID 19 and

                    The summit
                    is expected to create a network of social innovation researchers and practitioners to advance
                    evidence-based
                    research
                    and best practices on social entrepreneurship in Africa.
                    Finally, to respond to the need for capacity building for the social innovators will create a
                    network ecosystem
                    player
                    in training who can support continuous capacity development for social innovators.</p>
