                <p>Under the global post COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing Russia-Ukraine war era, local and innovative
                  solutions to service
                  delivery in contexts where traditional actors or the market have failed are needed more than ever
                  (Agapitova et al.,
                  2020). Unemployment anxieties, psychological trauma disturbances, health problems and undesirable
                  economic shocks have
                  hit the poor, vulnerable, and those in the informal economy the hardest, particularly in Africa.
                  Populations struggle to
                  meet their most basic needs for food, water, energy, or health care following job loss and sickness.
                  Businesses face
                  lower demand for their products and services, which creates high cash flow concerns. When available,
                  governments’
                  policies and measures are not easily accessible in rural areas or to unregistered workers and firms.
                  These challenges
                  increasingly deteriorate the hard living environment in weak communities and fragile African countries
                  such as
                  Congo-Kinshasa (DRC).
                  A review of international experiences by the World Bank (2016) demonstrates that an increasing number of
                  governments
                  across the world successfully include Social Entreprises (SEs) in their policy agendas to address
                  institutional and
                  market failures in service delivery to the poor and to promote sustainable and equitable growth. SEs are
                  private
                  non-profit, for-profit or hybrid organizations that use business methods to advance their social mission
                  in a
                  financially sustainable way. SEs focus on maximizing the public good as opposed to maximizing short-term
                  profits for
                  their shareholders and private owners. Due to their strong presence and understanding of local
                  communities, SEs are
                  often able to reach the underserved through innovative solutions. In addition to economic growth and
                  wealth generation,
                  social entrepreneurs can also create considerable social benefits, especially when they push the
                  frontier of developing
                  markets and start delivering critical goods and services to poor and marginalized populations.
                  Although Africa is a relative latecomer to social business (entrepreneurship), the expansion of SEs
                  across the continent
                  has been impressive in the last decade. The 2016 survey of a sample of 234 successful social
                  entrepreneurs in East and
                  Southern Africa demonstrated considerable sectoral growth since 2006. South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, and
                  Nigeria for
                  instance have become hubs for SEs that are active across all service delivery areas and many are
                  reaching impressive
                  scale. Assessments of SE ecosystems have showed that SEs improved access to education, clean water, and
                  energy for
                  millions of Africans, including in the most fragile areas (Navarrete and Agapitova 2017). However, the
                  continent social
                  business dynamics needs to be sustainably reinforced and many other countries need to adopt and
                  implement the model. In
                  some African countries, the private sector’s emergence in providing goods and services is constrained by
                  the difficult
                  country’s contexts. In others, though many opportunities exist for service provision through
                  concessions, public-private
                  partnerships (PPP), and other private sector initiatives, market-based solutions are rare and relatively
                  small in scale.
                  Elsewhere, projects that aim to develop basic service delivery units, such as roads, schools and
                  clinics, are not based
                  on sustainable business models powered by local entrepreneurs.
                  With the rapid increase of population in Africa and the existing and emerging complex social problems
                  namely brought by
                  the COVID-17 pandemic and ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, making Africa one of the world most
                  vulnerable places, there
                  is an urgent need for a broader panafrican thinking and collaboration in considering the issue, which
                  aids and inspires
                  far greater commitment for social innovation. The DRC Social Innovation Summit (DRC-SIS) is envisioned
                  to contribute to
                  strengthen this important and strategic discussion on social innovation in DRC by inspiring and
                  implementing innovative
                  and sustainable solutions for climate change adaptation and resilience, particularly in Africa.

                <h3> SUMMIT RATIONAL</h3>
                <p>According to UNICEF, the African population will reach 2.4 billion by 2050, with the vast majority
                  under the age of 35.
                  To feed and employ this population, catalytic innovations in health, education, agriculture,
                  transportation, water
                  management, energy, sanitation, and housing will be required. Sustainable improvements in service
                  delivery in Africa
                  will not happen without the participation and capacity building of local actors. The retrenchment of
                  the State,
                  decentralization (devolution), and liberalization of some service sectors have the potential to
                  bring development closer
                  to people and open the door for the private sector (World Bank, 2018).
  
                  While the African continent and Congo-Kinshasa have emerging social innovators and entrepreneurs,
                  they face challenges
                  in scaling and replicating their initiatives, sustaining them in the face of insufficient funding
                  and intellectual
                  property frameworks, fostering cross-sector partnerships, and measuring impact. In the face of
                  complex social
                  challenges, there is an urgent need to advance social innovation as a transformational engine. It is
                  also critical to
                  consider cross-sector collaboration in order to achieve social transformation. Simultaneously, it is
                  critical to
                  consider the transformative power of social innovation and its importance to our society. There are
                  numerous players in
                  the social entrepreneurship ecosystem who contribute to the diversity of social enterprise support.
                  A single actor
                  cannot successfully resolve the complexities of social problems. The effective growth of social
                  enterprise in Africa
                  necessitates collaboration and synergy among ecosystem players. It is critical to connect various
                  actors in social
                  entrepreneurship, maintain conversation among them, and learn from one another.
                  Therefore, DRC-SIS is an event that brings together the various players from across Congo-Kinshasa,
                  Africa and
                  internationally in order for them to be more effective in their support they provide for the growth
                  of the ecosystem. We
                  must learn from social innovations that have proven to be successful in Congo and other African
                  countries, and that can
                  be replicated elsewhere. Hence is it important to connect social entrepreneurs to learn from
                  successful social
                  innovations and create partnerships for replicating the models.</p>

                <h3> ABOUT THE DRC SOCIAL INNOVATION SUMMIT</h3>
                <p>For the first time in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s history, the DRC Social Innovation Summit
                  (DRC-SIS) has
                  partnered with AgroMwinda Leadership Academy (ALA) and the Tangaza University College - Institute
                  for Social
                  Transformation (Catholic University of Eastern Africa, CUEA, Nairobi-Kenya) to launch the Social
                  Innovation Summit.
                  Both the DRC Social Innovation Summit (DRC-SIS), AgroMwinda Leadership Academy (ALA) and Tangaza
                  University College-
                  Institute for Social Transformation (TUC-IST) were part of the African Social Business Conference
                  organized in Nairobi
                  (Kenya) and the DRC Investment Summit that took place in Kinshasa in June 2022 and saw these events
                  as great
                  opportunities to bring a larger critical mass of community members and leaders to this podium to
                  meet and discuss with
                  top global, regional and local social innovators and policymakers from various industries.
                  500 social innovators, entrepreneurs, investors, researchers and policymakers across Africa and
                  around the world will
                  converge at Fleuve Congo Hotel in Kinshasa from 27-29 November 2022 alongside other delegates to
                  showcase research
                  findings, policy outcomes and their innovative ideas and initiatives while providing a social
                  innovation edge to the
                  summit.</p>

                <div class="content">
                  <p>According to Frantz Fanon, one of the most prominent panafricanists, “Africa has the shape of a
                    revolver whose trigger
                    is in Congo”. This description of the Congo is enough to understand non only the importance of
                    this country in the heart
                    of Africa, but also its potential for envisaging domestic and innovative solutions to service
                    delivery in the continent:
                    second largest and fourth most populated African country, 50% of African forest, 80.000.000 of
                    arable lands, 37% of the
                    potential of African energy, ¾ of the world reserve of coltan, 50% of cobalt, 30% of diamonds and
                    10% of copper.
                    Although the DRC is a relative latecomer to social business, the sector is growing and receiving
                    increased recognition
                    from customers, donors, and the government. Equally important has been the remarkable re-emergence
                    of grassroots SEs as
                    an integral part of a Congolese bottom-up phenomenon, and the rapid rise of new information and
                    communication technology
                    (ICT) in certain areas of service delivery (Agapitova et al., 2020). By choosing Kinshasa as the
                    host city of this
                    panafrican conference on social innovation, we would like to celebrate the Congo’s geostrategic
                    position in Africa and
                    reinforce the social innovation dynamics in view to unlocking the panafrican sustainable
                    development dream.</p>
